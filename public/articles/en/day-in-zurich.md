The Züri Edit: Architecture, Lake Breezes, and Luxury Vibes under CHF 100. A curated guide through the City on the Limmat – from hidden Giacomettis to sunset by the lake. On sunny days: bring a towel and swimwear – Lake Zurich is calling!

## The Giacometti Hall (Blüemlihalle)

⏱️ **20 min** | 🆓 Free (Photo ID required at reception)

The day begins in the so-called "Blüemlihalle" (Flower Hall), located within the entrance portal of the police station at Bahnhofquai. While the building itself is a massive stone structure, an architectural surprise awaits inside: In the 1920s, Augusto Giacometti transformed the vaulted ceilings into a vibrant sea of red and orange ornaments. This explosion of color on the ceiling and columns is considered one of the most important works of modern mural painting in Switzerland.

*→ 10 min walk along the Limmat*

## The Niederdorf (Old Town)

⏱️ **45 min**

The "Dörfli," as locals call the part of the Old Town on the right bank, is characterized by narrow, cobblestone alleys and historical guild houses. The architecture spans from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance. The facades along the Limmatquai, in particular, tell the story of the city's rich trading history. It is the perfect place to explore Zurich's urban heritage away from the noise of cars.

*→ 5 min walk*

## Grossmünster & Cloister

⏱️ **40 min**

The Grossmünster, with its iconic twin towers, is a Romanesque masterpiece. While the towers dominate the skyline, the true treasure lies within: the modern stained-glass windows by Sigmar Polke, made of thinly sliced agate, and the windows by Augusto Giacometti in the choir. The adjacent Romanesque cloister, with its intricately decorated capitals, offers a sanctuary of almost monastic silence.

*→ 10 min walk across the Münsterbrücke*

## Lindenhof – The Historical Stronghold

⏱️ **30 min**

This elevated square in the heart of the Old Town marks the site where a Roman fort and later a Carolingian royal palace once stood. Today, the architecture is minimalist: a wide, tree-lined terrace with stone benches. From here, you enjoy a majestic view over the rooftops of the Niederdorf and the Limmat. It is the city's most prestigious viewpoint, yet accessible to everyone.

*→ 15 min walk towards Heimplatz*

## Kunsthaus Zürich (Chipperfield Extension)

⏱️ **1:45** | 🎟️ approx. CHF 23 (Collection entry)

Switzerland's largest art museum impresses primarily through the light-flooded extension designed by David Chipperfield. The architecture stands out with its strict Jura limestone facade and a monumental entrance hall. Here, classical modernism meets contemporary clarity. The collection features masterpieces by Monet, Munch, and Picasso, presented in a setting that rivals the elegance of Parisian museums.

*→ 10 min walk to Sechseläutenplatz*

## Lunch: Pizza Nation & Opera House

⏱️ **45 min** | ☕ approx. CHF 12

Directly on the sprawling Sechseläutenplatz, you'll find Pizza Nation, serving handcrafted pizza slices that are remarkably budget-friendly for Zurich standards. The square itself, paved with 16,000 square meters of Valser quartzite, provides the perfect picnic spot against the backdrop of the Neo-Baroque Opera House. The Opera House's light stone facade and statues of famous composers create a noble contrast to the modern hustle and bustle on the square.

*→ 5 min walk to Bürkliplatz*

## "Züri rollt" & Lakeside Promenade

⏱️ **45 min** | 🆓 Free (CHF 20 deposit, fully refunded)

At Bürkliplatz, grab a free rental bike from "Züri rollt." The ride takes you along General-Guisan-Quai, passing magnificent Belle Époque buildings. The wide promenade is lined with old plane trees and offers an unobstructed view of the Glarus Alps. This is "Gold Coast" architecture at its most accessible.

*→ 10 min by bike*

## Jump into the Lake: Rentenwiese

⏱️ **1:15**

Rentenwiese is the democratic answer to private lidos. People gather here to swim in the crystal-clear waters of Lake Zurich. The openness of the meadow and the view of sailing boats bobbing in the Enge harbor immediately evoke a sense of summer bliss and freedom. Unpack your towel and enjoy the view of Uto-Quai.

*→ 10 min by bike towards Zürichhorn*

## Pavillon Le Corbusier

⏱️ **30 min**

This colorful gem on the shores of Lake Zurich is the final project realized by architecture pioneer Le Corbusier. In contrast to his signature raw concrete buildings, this pavilion consists of vibrant steel plates and glass. The building is a "Gesamtkunstwerk" (total work of art) that unites Corbusier's vision of architecture, art, and life. Its geometric precision and primary colors make it one of the city's most photographed landmarks.

*→ 5 min by bike*

## Zurich Chinese Garden

⏱️ **40 min** | 🎟️ approx. CHF 4

An architectural gift from the partner city of Kunming. The garden belongs to the category of temple gardens and is one of the highest-ranking gardens outside of China. The ensemble of bridges, pavilions, and a small lake is laid out according to Feng Shui principles. The ornately decorated wooden structures and the "Three Friends of Winter" path offer an aesthetic that is unique in Switzerland.

*→ 15 min by bike back to Bürkliplatz*

## Limmat River Boat Trip

⏱️ **25 min** | 🚢 approx. CHF 4.40 (Short-haul ticket)

After returning the bikes, hop onto a Limmat boat. These boats are designed with a low profile to glide under the city's low bridges. From the water, you get a completely new perspective on the Town Hall, the guild houses, and the Fraumünster church. The journey from the lake basin back into the city is one of the most relaxing ways to enjoy architecture on the move.

*→ 10 min walk towards Bellevue*

## Gelateria di Berna

⏱️ **15 min** | ☕ approx. CHF 5

A quick stop for arguably the best gelato in town. The shops are sleek and modern, focusing entirely on handcrafted quality. Whether you choose a vegan fruit sorbet or creamy classics – this ice cream is an institution and part of the Zurich lifestyle.

*→ 5 min walk to Bellevue*

## Dinner: Sternen Grill

⏱️ **40 min** | ☕ approx. CHF 14 (incl. drink)

The grand finale takes place at one of Zurich's most famous addresses. Sternen Grill at Bellevue is a local icon. Here, gastronomy is democratized: bank directors and students eat side-by-side, savoring the legendary St. Gallen bratwurst. For vegetarians, there is an excellent plant-based bratwurst grilled over an open fire. The absolute highlight is the house-made, extremely spicy gold mustard, served only with a fresh "Bürli" (bread roll).

*→ 10 min walk to the lakeside path*

## Sunset at Utoquai

⏱️ **60 min**

The day ends at Utoquai. As the sun sinks behind the Uetliberg, it bathes the Alps and the city's church spires in golden light. The wide wooden promenade offers plenty of seating. It is the perfect place to watch the city's architecture glow in the evening light and reflect on the day.
