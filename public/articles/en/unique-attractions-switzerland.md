Switzerland is a land of contrasts. In a very small space, you will find massive natural wonders that leave you in awe and historical buildings that whisper stories from past centuries. To truly understand Switzerland, you must look beyond the well-known paths. Here are the attractions you must see – divided into nature, history, and modern highlights.

## Natural Wonders

Nature is the biggest star in Switzerland. The **Rhine Falls near Schaffhausen** is the most powerful waterfall in Europe. The masses of water plunging down here create an elemental force that is best felt on a boat trip very close to the central rock. A completely different picture is offered by the **Aletsch Glacier** in Valais. At 23 kilometers long, it is the largest glacier in the Alps and part of a UNESCO World Heritage site. You get the best view from the summit of the Eggishorn. For fans of dramatic rock formations, the **Creux du Van** in the Neuchâtel Jura is a must. This giant, natural rock cirque resembles the Grand Canyon and offers spectacular views and rich wildlife.

## Historical Sites

In Switzerland, history is often within reach. **Château de Chillon** near Montreux is picturesquely perched on a rock on Lake Geneva. It is the most visited historical building in Switzerland and inspired Lord Byron to write his poems. In central Switzerland, the **Chapel Bridge in Lucerne** is the ultimate landmark. The oldest wooden bridge in Europe, dating back to 1333, is famous for its triangular paintings under the roof. If you prefer strolling through medieval alleys, the **Old Town of Bern** is your place. As a UNESCO World Heritage site, its 6-kilometer-long arcades (Lauben) offer the longest covered shopping promenade in Europe and exude a very special, decelerated charm.

## Modern Highlights

Switzerland can also be futuristic and dizzyingly modern. The **Titlis Cliff Walk** suspension bridge is the highest in Europe and is located at over 3,000 meters. Walking across the 100-meter-long abyss requires nerves of steel but is rewarded with an unforgettable view over the mountain world. Less technical but just as impressive is the **Staubbach Waterfall in Lauterbrunnen**. It falls almost 300 meters freely and seems so ethereal that it inspired Goethe to his famous poem "Song of the Spirits over the Waters."

## Insider Tips

Away from the major tourist crowds, there are places that seem almost magical:

- **Via Mala Gorge**: Near Thusis, the waters of the Hinterrhein have carved their way up to 300 meters deep into the rock. A narrow path leads through this mystical, dark gorge.
- **Lake Cauma near Flims**: It is often referred to as the most beautiful mountain lake in Switzerland. Its turquoise water amidst deep forests is almost reminiscent of the Caribbean, only with a panorama of the Alps.
- **Gandria on Lake Lugano**: This small fishing village at the foot of Monte Brè is one of the most romantic destinations in Ticino. It is accessible almost only by boat or via a picturesque lakeside path and has preserved its original charm.
