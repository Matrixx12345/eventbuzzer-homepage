The Swiss Alps are more than just a backdrop for postcards; they are a massive playground for anyone seeking adventure and freedom. If you want to leave the daily grind behind in the lowlands, there is no better place to fill your lungs with fresh mountain air and let your gaze wander over endless peaks. Whether you are an experienced alpinist or simply looking for a leisurely stroll with a view, the mountain experience in Switzerland is incomparable.

## Why take a mountain trip in Switzerland?

It is the combination of wild nature and perfect infrastructure that makes Switzerland a hiking paradise. You don't have to be a pro to stand at 3,000 meters, as the densest network of mountain railways in the world takes you almost anywhere. The hiking trails are superbly marked: from yellow signs for leisurely paths to white-red-white markings for demanding mountain tours. The panorama of snow-capped peaks and deep blue mountain lakes ensures that you won't want to put your phone down. Regions like Grindelwald, Zermatt, or the Engadin are absolute classics that you must see at least once in your life.

## The best regions for mountain excursions

### Bernese Oberland: Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau

This region is the epicenter of Swiss alpinism. The triumvirate of Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau dominates the landscape and attracts visitors from all over the world. An absolute highlight is the trip with the Jungfrau Railway to the Jungfraujoch. At 3,454 meters above sea level, you are at the highest railway station in Europe. From up there, you have a direct view of the Aletsch Glacier, the longest ice stream in the Alps. For those who prefer to be more active, the area around Kleine Scheidegg or First near Grindelwald offers hiking trails that lead you directly to the mighty Eiger North Face.

### Valais & Zermatt: In the shadow of the Matterhorn

Valais is the home of the four-thousanders. At its center, of course, is Zermatt with the Matterhorn, arguably the most photographed mountain in the world. The region offers everything from gentle family hikes to extreme climbing routes. If you are looking for the classic view of the "Horu," as the locals call the Matterhorn, you should take the rack railway up to the Gornergrat. The observation deck offers a 360-degree panorama of 29 four-thousanders. For hikers, the Five Lakes Walk is a must, where the Matterhorn reflects perfectly in the mountain lakes on a calm day.

### Graubünden & Engadin: Pure nature on the high plateau

Graubünden is the canton of 150 valleys and offers a completely different, often sun-drenched alpine setting. The Engadin is famous for its wide high plateau and the crystal-clear lakes of St. Moritz and Silvaplana. Here, the mountains often seem more massive and rustic. The Swiss National Park in Zernez is the only one of its kind and a paradise for wildlife watching. For those who prefer to enjoy the mountains in a relaxed way, hop on the Bernina Express and travel over the Bernina Pass – one of the most spectacular railway lines in the world, which is even a UNESCO World Heritage site.

## Tips for your mountain trip

To ensure your day at high altitude is truly enjoyable, you should keep a few things in mind:

- **Check the weather**: The weather in the Alps can change within minutes. Use local apps and check the webcams of the mountain railways before you start.
- **The right equipment**: Good hiking boots with tread are a must. Pack a rain jacket, warm clothing (layering principle!), and plenty of sun protection – the UV radiation up there is treacherous.
- **Start early**: Morning is often the most stable time in the mountains. Plus, you'll avoid the biggest crowds at the famous hotspots.
- **Use mountain railways**: Don't underestimate the vertical meters. There is no shame in taking the gondola for the ascent and enjoying the hike at the top.
