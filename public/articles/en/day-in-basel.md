Basel is Switzerland's cultural treasure trove – compact, stylish and full of surprises. Whether world-class museums, medieval alleyways or culinary delights by the Rhine: A day in Basel is a perfect mix of culture, enjoyment and relaxation. We've put together a route that takes you through the most beautiful corners of the city.

## 09:00 – Fondation Beyeler: Art in the Park

Your day begins in Riehen, a quiet suburb of Basel. Here lies the **Fondation Beyeler**, one of the most beautiful museums in the world. The light-flooded building by Renzo Piano houses masterpieces by Monet, Picasso, Rothko and many more. The collection of Hildy and Ernst Beyeler is one of Europe's most significant private art collections, and the museum itself is an architectural jewel that perfectly combines art and nature.

Plan about 1.5 to 2 hours to stroll through the exhibition rooms and enjoy the changing special exhibitions. Afterwards, a walk through the adjacent Berower Park is worthwhile – in spring everything blooms here, in autumn the trees glow golden.

**Tip:** Combine your museum visit with an early lunch at **Restaurant Beyeler im Park**, located right next to the museum. Here you'll find seasonal Swiss cuisine in a relaxed atmosphere – perfect for starting the day energized.

## 11:30 – Villa Wenkenhof: Panoramic View over Basel

Just a 10-minute walk from the Fondation Beyeler lies **Villa Wenkenhof**, an insider tip for anyone wanting to see Basel from above. The neoclassical villa sits atop a hill and offers a wonderful view over the city, the Rhine and as far as the Vosges. The estate itself is not always publicly accessible, but the surrounding park and viewing terrace are freely accessible and a perfect spot for some photos.

## 12:30 – Back to the Old Town: Sutter Begg Bakery

After returning to the city center (Tram 6 from Riehen Dorf to Barfüsserplatz, approx. 15 min.), it's time for a stop at **Sutter Begg**. This traditional Basel bakery has cult status and is famous for its Basler Läckerli, Brunsli and freshly baked breads. The smell alone is an experience. Ideal for buying some souvenirs or simply enjoying a coffee and a piece of cake.

## 13:00 – Basel Town Hall: Red Jewel at the Market Square

The **Basel Town Hall** is one of the city's most striking buildings. The bright red sandstone structure with golden ornaments dates from the 16th century and is the seat of the Basel government. The inner courtyard is freely accessible and offers a beautiful photo opportunity with its colorful frescoes and magnificent architecture. If you're lucky, you can also join one of the free guided tours that are regularly offered.

## 14:00 – Basel Minster: Gothic Masterpiece

From the Town Hall it's just a few minutes' walk to **Basel Minster**, the city's landmark. The Gothic cathedral made of red sandstone towers majestically above the Rhine and is impressive both outside and inside. Particularly worth seeing are the Romanesque portals, the tomb of Erasmus of Rotterdam and the colorful stained glass windows. If you're fit, you can climb the tower and be rewarded with a fantastic panoramic view over Basel and the Rhine.

## 15:00 – Pfalz: Relax with Rhine Views

Directly behind the Minster lies the **Pfalz**, an elevated terrace overlooking the Rhine and the old town. Here locals and tourists alike meet to sit on the steps, enjoy the sun and watch the ferries shuttling back and forth. It's the perfect place to take a break, let your gaze wander over the water and feel Basel's relaxed way of life.

## 15:30 – Münster Ferry: Across the Rhine Without an Engine

From the Pfalz, head down to the Rhine riverbank where you can board the **Münsterfähre**. This traditional Rhine ferry is powered exclusively by the river's current – a unique experience! The short crossing takes you to the Kleinbasel side, where you can walk along the Rhine riverbank. The route then leads you back to the Grossbasel shore via the striking **Dreirosenbrücke** (Three Roses Bridge) – a beautiful end to the walk.

## 17:30 – Les Trois Rois: Sundowner by the Rhine

Your day ends in style at the **Grand Hotel Les Trois Rois**, one of Europe's oldest and most elegant hotels.
